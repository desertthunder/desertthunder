### Owais J :zap:

Hey there! I'm Owais, a software engineer from Austin, TX with a little over half a
decade of experience working in or education. In a past life I had dreams of being an
infectious disease researcher, but quickly found that solving problems with programming
and trying to build good software are near infinite wells of joy for me.

Right now I'm working on a few projects for a company I've started, called
[Stormlight Labs](https://stormlightlabs.org) where I'm trying to build software that
helps people [take care](https://volkara.stormlightlabs.org) of themselves and each other
(with some libraries and developer [tools](https://github.com/stormlightlabs/volt)
mixed in).

Here are some open source libraries I maintain:

#### Writing

Most days I find myself writing a fair bit, mostly to do a good impression of

[plan](https://github.com/ESWAT/john-carmack-plan-archive/) files.

You can view those on my [blog](https://desertthunder.dev). Some of my notes and reference
material is recorded/planted in my [digital garden](https://desertthunder.github.io/garden).
