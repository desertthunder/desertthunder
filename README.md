### Owais J :zap:

Hey there! I'm Owais, a software engineer from Austin, TX with a little bit
over half a decade of experience working in or education. In a past life I
had dreams of being an infectious disease researcher, but quickly found that
solving problems with programming and trying to build good software are near
infinite wells of joy for me.

Right now I'm working on a few projects for a company I've started, called
[Stormlight Labs](https://stormlightlabs.org) where I'm trying to build software
that helps people take care of themselves and each other (with some libraries and
developer tools mixed in).

#### Contact Information

I'm currently seeking a new role! If you'd like a copy of my resume or would like
