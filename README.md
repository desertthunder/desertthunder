### Owais J :zap:

Hey there! I'm Owais, a software engineer from Austin, TX with a little bit
over half a decade of experience working in or education. In a past life I
had dreams of being an infectious disease researcher, but quickly found that
solving problems with programming and trying to build good software are near
infinite wells of joy for me.

Right now I'm working on a few projects for a company I've started, called
[Stormlight Labs](https://stormlightlabs.org) where I'm trying to build software
that helps people take care of themselves and each other (with some libraries and
developer tools mixed in). I'm also learning more about functional programming
and the .NET ecosystem through mostly [F#](https://leanpub.com/essential-fsharp)
and native mobile development.

#### Contact Information

I'm currently seeking a new role! If you'd like a copy of my resume or would like
to chat, my email address is `jamil.owais <at> gmail.com`.

#### Projects

- A flutter [app](https://github.com/stormlightlabs/soulbloom) that gives you
  ideas for self-care and reflection
- Rust based developer tooling, like an LSP for Python
- 100 Days to Offload on my personal [blog](https://desertthunder.pages.dev)
